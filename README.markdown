# GNU Bash Shell Script Template
[![This project's current build status on Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/Lin-Buo-Ren/GNU-Bash-Shell-Script-Template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Lin-Buo-Ren/GNU-Bash-Shell-Script-Template)  
This project provides easy-to-use shell script templates for GNU Bash for users to create new scripts.

## Features
### Debugger-friendly

Local debuggers need fresh livers, we made scripts more error-proof and bug-aware by bailing out whenever a potential scripting error is found.

Secure programming paradigms like [Unofficial Bash Strict Mode](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/) and [Defensive BASH Programming](https://frippertronics.com/posts/defensive_bash_programming.html) are incorporated into the template design.

### Developer-friendly

We want developers to fucus on their code instead of the template's, so we moved developer related code like the `init`function, `print_help_message` function and `process_commandline_arguments` function to the start of the script and rest of the support code at the bottom.

The template is fully versioned at the bottom of the script, which is useful to upgrade your script to new template versions for new features and fixes.

### Beginner-friendly

The code is documented with essential pointers for beginner to lookup with, like relevant [GNU Bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/) sections, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) answers and [Bash Hackers Wiki](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org) articles.

### Full of Functionalities

We have incorporated the following features into the templates, so that user don't need to recreate wheels.

* Integrated runtime dependency checking
* ERR/EXIT/INT traps for exception handling
* Command-line argument parsing with GNU long variant option support
* `--help` message printing
* Frequently used primitive variables
  * RUNTIME_EXECUTABLE_PATH  
    `/home/username/somewhere/My Awesome Script.bash`
  * RUNTIME_EXECUTABLE_FILENAME  
    `My Awesome Script.bash`
  * RUNTIME_EXECUTABLE_NAME  
    `My Awesome Script`
  * RUNTIME_EXECUTABLE_DIRECTORY  
    `/home/username/somewhere`
  * RUNTIME_COMMANDLINE_BASECOMMAND  
    A guessed command string that user used to run the script
    * `My Awesome Script.bash` if the script is in the executable search `PATH`s (only in full variant)
    * `${0}`otherwises.
  * RUNTIME_COMMANDLINE_PARAMETERS  
    An array of command-line parameters

### Space and non-ASCII Characters Friendly

Script won't broke in an exotic environment.

### With Installer that can Install Templates to XDG-compliant File Manager Applications

Supports:

* Dolphin
* GNOME Files
* Thunar
* and more...(as long as they are compliant)

### Need More or Less?  You're Covered

The following variants are provided:

* **PRIMITIVE**  
  The recommended variant for regular use, core functionalities included.
* **MILIMALISTIC**  
  If you want it more simpler and don't mind recreating a few more wheels.
* **FULL**  
  Hundreds of lines of support code, including additional features like:
  * Stacktrace printing
  * Multiple installation configuration support: Standalone/SHC/FHS, conforming to the [Flexible Software Installation Specification](https://github.com/Lin-Buo-Ren/Flexible-Software-Installation-Specification)
  * Utility functions like `meta_util_array_shift`
  * ...and more
* **SOURCE'D**  
  Template for source'd code, with include guard support
* **VANILLA.BASH**  
  [Vanilla.bash* is a fast, lightweight, backward compatible template for building incredible, powerful GNU Bash applications.](https://github.com/Lin-Buo-Ren/Vanilla.bash)

### Verified, as Always

The code is continuously verified by [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) to not containing any potential pitfalls.
